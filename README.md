# ArcGIS Favorite Tools Add-In
A collection of some of my favorite custom tools within an Add-In Tab for ease-of-use. 


## Contents
- ArcGIS Pro Add-In (Dockpane + tools)
- Custom geoprocessing tools
- Supporting scripts

## Requirements
- ArcGIS Pro 3.5

## Installation
1. Clone or download this repository
2. Open the `.sln` file in Visual Studio
3. Build the solution
4. The add-in will load automatically in ArcGIS Pro

## Notes
Some tools need to be altered for them to work such as the google geocoding tool (you need your own API key) and the global background spotlight (you need a path to a global polygon layer)
